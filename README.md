# School Scripts

A simple repo with scripts that give answers to small **math games**
and puzzles with code.

## How do you run them?
The **only** way to run the program is to open it 
in a code editor and run it **there**.

## How can you contribute?

The project is very **small** and any help in terms of **UI**
or any other elements like that will be **appreciated**.

In terms of the actual **code**, I will have to review any 
pull requests regarding the algorithms.
